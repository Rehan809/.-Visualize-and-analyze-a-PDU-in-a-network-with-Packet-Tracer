Analyzing PDUs
PDUs represent the data being transferred across a network at different layers of the OSI model. In Packet Tracer, you can analyze PDUs in Simulation Mode by following these steps:
Capture the PDU:
While in Simulation Mode, create a PDU by clicking on the Add Simple PDU or Add Complex PDU button and selecting the source and destination devices.
Track PDU Movement:
Watch the PDU as it moves through the network, observing how it is encapsulated and decapsulated at each device and OSI layer.
Analyze Encapsulation and Decapsulation:
Inspect the details of each step, such as headers and payloads added or removed at layers like Ethernet, IP, or TCP.
Review Protocol Operations:
Examine the interactions between protocols, such as ARP requests, DNS lookups, or TCP handshakes.
Log Observations:
Use the simulation log to document each stage of the PDUâ€™s journey for troubleshooting or educational purposes.
Common PDU Types
ICMP: Used for Ping and Traceroute commands to diagnose connectivity issues.
TCP: Tracks the 3-way handshake and reliable data transfer processes.
UDP: Examines connectionless data transmission, e.g., for DNS queries.
HTTP/HTTPS: Traces web request and response cycles.
ARP: Resolves IP-to-MAC address mappings.
By understanding PDUs and their behavior, you can diagnose network issues, optimize configurations, and gain deeper insights into network protocols.
